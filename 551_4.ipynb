            "0 as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .\n",
            "0 when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .\n",
            "0 you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .\n",
            "0 i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .\n",
            "0 it 's as though nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use .\n",
            "0 i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone .\n",

            "0 my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .\n",
            "0 operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface .\n",
            "0 the phone must be shut down &amp; taken apart to change the memory card . . . and turning the phone back on takes a little while .\n",

            "0 styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .\n",
            "0 it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .\n",

            "0 this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .\n",
            "0 in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .\n",

            "0 you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .\n",
            "0 secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .\n",
            "0 the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .\n",
            "0 this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .\n",
            "0 the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .\n",
            "0 the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .\n",
            "0 at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .\n",

            "0 1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .\n",
            "0 2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .\n",
            "0 3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .\n",
            "0 4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the \" other than phone \" functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .\n",
            "0 basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .\n",
            "0 i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .\n",
            "0 i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one .\n",

            "1 fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .\n",
            "1 contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .\n",

            "1 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .\n",
            "1 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current &gt; 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .\n",

            "1 excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .\n",

            "1 i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .\n",

            "1 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .\n",
            "1 the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .\n",
            "1 the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .\n",
            "1 the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .\n",
            "1 the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .\n",
            "1 playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .\n",

            "1 it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .\n",

            "1 its really cool .\n",
            "1 sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .\n",
            "1 you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up , which is cool too .\n",
            "1 also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .\n",
            "1 first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .\n",
            "1 while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .\n",

            "1 a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .\n",
            "1 first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .\n",
            "1 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .\n",
            "1 second , the \" automatic \" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .\n",
            "1 the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .\n",
            "1 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .\n",
            "1 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .\n",
            "1 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .\n",
            "1 it also lets you remove songs from the play order .\n",
            "1 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .\n",
            "1 its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .\n",
            "1 i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .\n",
            "1 the software is quick &amp; easy to use &amp; i found the entire process very easily mastered .\n",
            "1 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car &amp; is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! .\n",
            "1 overall it is a great unit &amp; hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .\n",
            "1 this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .\n",
            "1 it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .\n",
            "1 extremely convenient .\n",
            "1 great price .\n",
            "1 i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all .\n",
            "1 i 'm really happy with this purchase .\n",
            "1 now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here .\n",
            "1 but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .\n",
            "1 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .\n",
            "1 * price and capacity\n",
            "1 * slick-looking design and improved interface\n",
            "1 * removable battery\n",
            "1 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .\n",
            "1 i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .\n",
            "1 file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .\n",
            "1 to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .\n",
            "1 the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .\n",
            "1 at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .\n",
            "1 i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .\n",
            "1 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .\n",
            "1 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .\n",
            "1 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .\n",
            "1 ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .\n",
            "1 considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .\n",
            "1 it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .\n",
            "1 after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .\n",
            "1 first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .\n",
            "1 it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .\n",
            "1 the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .\n",
            "1 you can create playlists , drag &amp; drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .\n",
            "1 and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .\n",
            "1 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .\n",
            "1 i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .\n",
            "1 they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .\n",
            "1 i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .\n",
            "1 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .\n",
            "1 the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click .\n",
            "1 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .\n",
            "1 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .\n",
            "1 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .\n",
            "1 i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .\n",
            "1 the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .\n",
            "1 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .\n",
            "1 i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .\n",
            "1 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .\n",
            "1 + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .\n",
            "1 + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit\n",
            "1 + screen was good , easy to read\n",

            "1 overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .\n",

            "1 fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .\n",
            "1 thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .\n",
            "1 while i have not had the \" privilege \" , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones .\n",
            "1 by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .\n",
            "1 while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .\n",
            "1 about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to \" hip \" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the \" awkward \" factor .\n",
            "1 it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .\n",
            "1 the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .\n",
            "1 battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .\n",
            "1 transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .\n",
            "1 also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .\n",
            "1 all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .\n",
            "1 initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .\n",
            "1 the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .\n",
            "1 fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .\n",
            "1 i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .\n",
            "1 however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .\n",
            "1 as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .\n",
            "1 i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .\n",
            "1 after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .\n",
            "1 perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .\n",
            "1 whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .\n",
            "1 when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .\n",
            "1 it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .\n",
            "1 the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .\n",
            "1 moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .\n",
            "1 there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .\n",
            "1 speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .\n",
            "1 overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .\n",
            "1 transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .\n",
            "1 it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .\n",
            "1 strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .\n",
            "1 colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from .\n",
            "1 you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a \" special edition \" to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable/replaceable .\n",
            "1 - audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma . . . and yeah , wav too .\n",
            "1 you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .\n",
            "1 this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .\n",
            "1 the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .\n",
            "1 it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .\n",
            "1 creative did an awesome job with the design .\n",
            "1 the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .\n",
            "1 i have the black one and adore it .\n",
            "1 it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .\n",
            "1 i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .\n",
            "1 overall , i 've been very impressed with the player .\n",
            "1 i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .\n",
            "1 i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .\n",
            "1 i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .\n",
            "1 one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .\n",
            "1 its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .\n",
            "1 the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .\n",
            "1 they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .\n",
            "1 also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .\n",
            "1 its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .\n",
            "1 the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .\n",
            "1 so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .\n",
            "1 they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .\n",
            "1 i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .\n",
            "1 this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .\n",
            "1 everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .\n",
            "1 the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .\n",
            "1 the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that \" creative \" branding is all over the place within it .\n",
            "1 songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .\n",
            "1 on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .\n",
            "1 so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .\n",
            "1 that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the \" add to cart \" button already ! .\n",
            "1 right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .\n",
            "1 so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .\n",
            "1 original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .\n",
            "1 this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .\n",

            "1 the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .\n",
            "1 overall , i am very pleased with it .\n",
            "1 the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .\n",
            "1 before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .\n",
            "1 the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .\n",
            "1 the player is smaller than you think .\n",
            "1 bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .\n",
            "1 the zen micro is near perfect .\n",
            "1 it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .\n",
            "1 the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .\n",
            "1 it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .\n",
            "1 the accessories that come with the player are great .\n",
            "1 white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .\n",
            "1 best in class .\n",
            "1 it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .\n",
            "1 creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .\n",
            "1 pick your favorite color and buy it .\n",
            "1 pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .\n",
            "1 it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .\n",
            "1 the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .\n",
            "1 if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .\n",
            "1 anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .\n",
            "1 the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .\n",
            "1 +looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .\n",
            "1 +battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .\n",
            "1 +sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .\n",
            "1 but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .\n",
            "1 overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )\n",
            "1 i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee .\n",
            "1 and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .\n",
            "1 it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .\n",
            "1 after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .\n",
            "1 the sound is very nice .\n",
            "1 i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .\n",
            "1 otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .\n",
            "1 however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .\n",
            "1 i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .\n",
            "1 i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .\n",
            "1 mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .\n",
            "1 its also smaller , and gets more looks .\n",
            "1 an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .\n",
            "1 this is really a no brain er .\n",
            "1 i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .\n",
            "1 better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .\n",
            "1 creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .\n",
            "1 the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .\n",
            "1 the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .\n",
            "1 if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .\n",
            "1 this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .\n",
            "1 i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .\n",
            "1 feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .\n",
            "1 on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .\n",
            "1 the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .\n",
            "1 the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .\n",
            "1 no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .\n",
            "1 i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .\n",
            "1 have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .\n",
            "1 as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .\n",
            "1 ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .\n",
            "1 actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .\n",
            "1 sound quality ? . phenomenal .\n",
            "1 unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .\n",
            "1 your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .\n",
            "1 five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .\n",
            "1 tough as nails .\n",
            "1 no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .\n",
            "1 flawless .\n",
            "1 ) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .\n",
            "1 the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .\n",
            "1 gets nice sound too .\n",
            "1 the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .\n",
            "1 in conclusion , this player is beautiful .\n",
            "1 power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .\n",
            "1 but it ; . you won 't regret it .\n",
            "1 this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .\n",
            "1 the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .\n",
            "1 the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .\n",
            "1 the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .\n",
            "1 i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .\n",
            "1 the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .\n",
            "1 t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .\n",
            "1 i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .\n",
            "1 it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .\n",
            "1 i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .\n",
            "1 why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .\n",
            "1 the extra gb is just a bonus .\n",
            "1 if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .\n",

            "1 the zen offered a great alternative .\n",
            "1 it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .\n",
            "1 the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .\n",
            "1 other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .\n",
            "1 transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .\n",
            "1 the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .\n",
            "1 the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .\n",
            "1 track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .\n",
            "1 ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .\n",
            "1 oh , and another is the cool \" halo \" light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .\n",
            "1 one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .\n",
            "1 two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .\n",
            "1 this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .\n",
            "1 otherwise , this is a great \" alternative \" mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .\n",
            "1 i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .\n",
            "1 i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .\n",
            "1 the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .\n",
            "1 it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .\n",
            "1 further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .\n",
            "1 i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .\n",
            "1 however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .\n",
            "1 some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .\n",
            "1 sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .\n",
            "1 as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .\n",
            "1 this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .\n",
            "1 these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .\n",
            "1 by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .\n",
            "1 when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .\n",
